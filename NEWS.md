Updates

* Reflects API changes with less aggregated data
* Follows UN COMTRADE notation (i.e. commodity instead of product)

* Does not drop reference year with inflation adjustment (https://github.com/ropensci/tradestatistics/issues/38)
* Takes max and min available years from the API instead of hardcoded values (https://github.com/ropensci/tradestatistics/pull/39)
