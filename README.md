international trade data. `tradestatistics` provides an easy way to

This is what the package does:

Using `tradestatistics` package is all about efficiency, without this
package you could obtain the same data from the API at the expense of
using additional time and effort for the same results. As an API wrapper
and utility program this package makes data obtaining faster and easier
for you.
